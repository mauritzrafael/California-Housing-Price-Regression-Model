# Capstone-Project-JCDS-3

Real estate remains a popular investment due to the consistent upward trend in property prices and the ease of access through property agents. However, accurately estimating housing prices is challenging. If priced too low, sellers incur losses; if too high, properties may remain unsold. Therefore, balancing prices is crucial, requiring careful analysis of property features and market trends.

This project aims to predict housing prices in California using a dataset from 1990. The model is built using various machine learning techniques and can be updated with more recent data to reflect current trends in the housing market.

The model still can be improved, with few notes based on its prediction result.
